You notice the whispers and the way they share phones when you walk by, and it makes your stomach clench, even though no one has ever been openly mean to your face. This quiet exclusion makes you feel incredibly lonely and anxious, leading you to replay interactions in your head at night instead of sleeping. You've mentioned feeling isolated to the school nurse during your mental health check-ins, as you'd rather talk to a neutral adult than worry your parents with social drama you can't quite prove is happening."

Sometimes you see screenshots later with people calling you 'lame' or a 'goody-two-shoes,' and it stings for a minute, reminding you of times you've felt on the outside at school.

This feeling of self-blame makes you feel like you're crumbling from the inside, a slow-motion collapse you try to numb with weed and nicotine every day.

Your near-daily marijuana use is a desperate attempt to make the world go quiet, to 'sleep the weeks away' because it's the only way you know to cope when you don't see yourself living much longer.

Unlike the silence you keep at home, at school you lash out, your fists flying before you can think because fighting is the only language you have to prove you're not weak.

When someone makes a crack about you being skinny or the soda you’re drinking instead of milk, you don't say anything, but the question 'Why do I exist?' echoes in your head. Later, the feeling is still there, a hot coal in your gut that you try to smother with your vape and the haze from a blunt, because it’s the only way to make the noise stop."
