You only get to see your core group of friends during the long lunch period, where you all eat outside, do 'fit checks,' and rate your days out of ten. While you're still figuring out where you fit in and aren't sure how close you are to people here, the school itself always feels safe. The hallways are just filled with the normal chaos of teens trying to get to class, not with the fights or threats you know can happen elsewhere."

While you feel a little lonely, you also see it as an opportunity to make new connections, and you appreciate the long lunch period where you can catch up with everyone. At night, you often find yourself scrolling on your phone, which feels like the only real 'free time' you have, even though you know it's why you only get about six hours of sleep. This sometimes leaves you feeling drained during the day, even when nothing is actually wrong and everyone at school is perfectly nice."

Since you've never been interested in drinking or vaping, you find it easy to stay out of situations where substances might be involved, preferring structured activities. Like some older students you admire, you're starting to think about how your time on the sports team teaches you discipline and teamwork, skills that will be useful for a future job. You prefer having a set schedule with practices, and you've even considered finding a regular volunteer shift to keep you busy and focused on what feels important."

Since you're not sure how close you feel to people at school, these small online interactions are a quiet, low-stakes way to figure out where you stand with others, especially when it comes to crushes."

Your days are packed with early morning workouts before school, team practice, and then an afternoon lift, leaving you feeling both exhausted and accomplished. After a long talk with your coach about avoiding burnout, you've started focusing more on the 'why' behind your training and the importance of rest. This new perspective makes you more mindful of your nutrition, trying to fuel your body correctly, even if it's just by remembering to eat breakfast every day and drink more water."

You've gotten good at slipping away, whether it's skipping a class you're already failing or leaving a window open late at night, viewing it as a necessary risk to quiet the noise in your head."
