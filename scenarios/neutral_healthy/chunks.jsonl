So basically what I'm trying to talk about for modesty is that when I was 13, I was trying to wear as skimpy as possible that my parents would let me, which wasn't very skimpy because they were very strict about my clothing. And in the end, I, you know, I'm actually wearing like even a little bit more modest.

You're supposed to talk different, act different, um, and dress different, obviously. So just because 80% of your school's wearing a certain top and a certain fit doesn't mean that that means that it's completely appropriate and normal and you should wear it too, you know? Like when you like want to keep up with the trends, especially like as a fashion content creator, we look at a lot of cute trends, but then I'm like, actually, I don't think that'd be really respectful to my body, respectful to God who created me to be wearing that. So I'm not gonna wear that. But sometimes it lowkey sucks when the fits are lowkey eating, lowkey cute little tops with a lot of slits and stuff like that. Honestly, it's all worth it, especially when like a Christian guy's looking for a wifey.

Well, according to our experts, it is a term used to describe our social and emotional well-being. Mental health is just as important as physical health and needs to be taken care of just the same. It is affected by many factors, including your genetics, your physical health, your life experiences, and more. We all have stress, and we all have mental health needs. To take care of our mental health, we have to balance out the stress. If we think of us all having a stress bucket. It gets filled up with different stressors. Schoolwork, conflict with friends, family, all different things fill up our bucket. But if it gets too full, it can lead to us feeling overwhelmed, burnt out, or worse. So, to take care of our mental health, we need to be able to relieve some of those stressors. You can do that by getting regular sleep, eating well, socializing with friends and family, going outside, and getting physical activity. Anything that helps us feel good. Imagine each time you relieve your stress, a small hole is made in the bucket, offloading the weight of all those stressors. Keeping it all in balance is key to mental wellness. Mental wellness is a lifelong process and is different for everyone. It doesn't mean always being happy, but rather that you're able to manage well in your day-to-day life. Mental wellness is a spectrum that goes up and down throughout our lives. There may be another term you're hearing, mental illness. Mental illness is one part of mental health. According to a survey from 2012, one in three Canadians will be affected by mental illness in their lifetime. A mental illness is a diagnosis, which may be determined by a doctor based on symptoms and how they affect a person's life. Mental illness is not the same as feeling distressed because of normal reactions to difficult situations, like losing a loved one or big changes, like moving to a new school. Everyone has feelings that can feel negative at times, like feeling sad or anxious, but not everyone has a mental illness. Sadness, for example, is not a mental illness. But if that sadness is paired with other symptoms like tiredness, irritability, a lack of enjoyment of things you used to enjoy, then that could be depression. Depression is a mental illness. Another common mental health concern is anxiety. Everyone can feel stressed or anxious at times, but not everyone has an anxiety disorder. People who are mentally ill can seek treatment. That can be in the form of medicines, like antidepressants. But that can also be in the form of therapy. A combination of both drugs and therapy is often recommended. Some mental illnesses may only last for a certain period of time. But many are lifelong health conditions.

OCD, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, is a real diagnosis, and making light of it can be harmful to those who are actually living with it. Some stigma comes from the fact that you can't see a mental illness, the same way you might be able to see a physical illness or disability. That's why they are often called invisible disabilities. This can make people hesitant to believe that someone is struggling and may even accuse them of being over dramatic. Talking about emotions can also be stigmatized. Sometimes society and expectations make you feel like you need to appear strong, and mental illness can be seen as weakness.

It highlights the importance of breaking down stigmas, providing culturally appropriate care, and offering support to those in need, while also emphasizing self-care.", "text": "So what are some strategies for taking care of mental health in all communities? Well, first off, is education. Advocates say that everyone should know more about mental health, mental wellness, and mental illness. That includes breaking down dangerous stigmas, and also spreading good information about where to get help when you need it. For kids, getting help with mental health concerns can mean relying on adults in our lives. But sometimes, those adults lack education too. Simone Saunders says that kids can bring home resources from school or share what they find online and start a conversation with their parents. A second strategy is access. People need to be able to access programs and treatments for mental health concerns. Healthcare professionals and mental health advocates have been raising alarm bells about the length of waitlists for youth healthcare. For example, a report from 2020 said that kids in Ontario are waiting an average 67 days for counseling and therapy, and 92 days for intensive treatment. These sorts of waitlists are common across Canada and is a big reason why advocates are asking governments to provide more resources to support mental healthcare. A part of access is also providing culturally appropriate and community-based approaches. As individuals, we can help each other out. That can mean being supportive when people reach out for help. And it means treating people with mental illnesses with care and kindness. It also means treating our own mental health and wellness with care and kindness. If you're in need of support, you can talk to a trusted adult, a school counselor, a health practitioner, or you can use services like Kids Help Phone. Mental health is a big deal. But it's not as scary a topic as I thought. What are some ways that you take care of your mental health?
